# Current location

We plan to move/convert the Threat Modeling Playbook to an OWASP repository (requested), for now please visit our [Toreon repo](https://github.com/Toreon/threat-model-playbook).

# Intro
We aim to improve product and software security with our new OWASP threat modeling playbook. We consider threat modeling as a foundational activity to improve your software assurance. We are convinced that a good threat modeling practice will measurably decrease security issues of delivered products.

As strong believers in open source, active OWASP collaborators and to increase our impact beyond our Toreon customers, we donate this threat modeling playbook to the community.

We hope you will use this playbook to improve your threat modeling practice. We also encourage you to provide feedback to our [OWASP threat modeling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling) community in order to make this playbook even better in our next release.

I thank our collaborators (in alphabetic order): Jonas Muylaert, Joris Van den Broeck, Sebastien Deleersnyder, Steven Wierckx and Thomas Heyman to help us create this first release. I also thank Toreon for its decision to donate this work to the threat modeling community.
